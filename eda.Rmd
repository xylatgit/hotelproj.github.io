### Overview
The data [**Hotel Booking Demand Dataset**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) were collected from two hotels (Resort hotel and City hotel) located in Portugal. It contains hotel booking information between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017. For a speedy performance of our predictive model, we only select data from 2016 for training.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

```{r data,echo=FALSE, message=F}
hotel_whole_df <- read.csv("./data/hotel_bookings.csv",na = c("", "NA", "NULL")) 
hotel_df <- hotel_whole_df %>% filter(arrival_date_year==2016)
```

The dimension of the original published dataset is `r nrow(hotel_whole_df)` rows by `r ncol(hotel_whole_df)` columns. After filtering instances from year 2016, the resulting dataset has `r nrow(hotel_df)` rows.   

We aim to explore the following questions using our exploratory data analysis:  

* Where do the guests come from?  
* How does price vary over the year?  
* What are the potential factors which could influence the cancellation of both hotels?


### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Home Country of Guests
```{r choropleth maps, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
hotel_df %>% 
  select(country, is_canceled) %>% 
  filter(is_canceled == 0) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_booking = n(),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    booking_percent = round(total_booking/sum(total_booking)*100, 2),
    text_label = str_c("Country: ", country, "\nBooking percent: ", booking_percent, "%")
  ) %>% 
  plot_ly(locations = ~country, z = ~booking_percent, type ="choropleth",
          colorscale="Viridis", zmin = 0, zmax = 30,
          text = ~text_label)  %>% 
  layout(title = "Home Country of Guests")
```                

```{r donut chart, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
hotel_df %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(booking_percent = round(count/sum(count)*100, 2)) %>% 
  filter(booking_percent > 0.5) %>% 
  plot_ly(labels = ~country, values = ~booking_percent) %>% 
  add_pie(hole = 0.6) %>% 
  layout(title = "Home Country of Guests", showlegend = T,
         xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
         yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
```

**Comment**:  As shown from the choropleth maps and the donut chart, most guests(39.4%) are Portuguese, with British and French guest come second and third.    

#### Price Fluctuation 
```{r adr_month, message=F,echo=F}

hotel_adr =
  hotel_df%>% 
  select(hotel, arrival_date_month,adr) %>%
  group_by(hotel, arrival_date_month) %>%
  filter(adr > 0) %>% 
  summarize(
    high_adr = mean(adr) + 0.5*sd(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    low_adr = mean(adr) - 0.5*sd(adr))%>% 
  arrange(match(arrival_date_month, month.name)) %>% 
  mutate(arrival_date_month = factor(arrival_date_month, levels = month.name)) 

fig1 = 
  hotel_adr %>%
  filter(hotel == "Resort Hotel") %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~arrival_date_month, y = ~high_adr,  
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', 
          line = list(color = 'transparent'),
          showlegend = TRUE,  name = 'High Resort Hotel') %>%
  
    add_trace(y = ~low_adr, 
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', 
          fill = 'tonexty',
          fillcolor =  'rgba(255,215,0,0.2)',
          line = list(color = 'transparent'), 
          showlegend = TRUE, 
          name = 'Low Resort Hotel' ) %>%  
  
    add_trace(x = ~ arrival_date_month, y = ~mean_adr, 
          type = "scatter", 
          mode = "lines", 
          line = list(color='rgb(255,215,0)'))

fig1 %>% 
  add_trace(data = hotel_adr %>% filter(hotel == "City Hotel"),
            x = ~arrival_date_month, y = ~high_adr,  
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', 
          line = list(color = 'transparent'),
          showlegend = TRUE,  name = 'High City Hotel') %>%
  
    add_trace(y = ~low_adr, 
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', 
          fill = 'tonexty',
          fillcolor =  'rgba(128,0,129,0.2)',
          line = list(color = 'transparent'), 
          showlegend = TRUE, 
          name = 'Low Resort Hotel' ) %>%  
  
    add_trace(x = ~ arrival_date_month, y = ~mean_adr, 
          type = "scatter", 
          mode = "lines", 
          line = list(color='rgb(128,0,128)')) %>% 
  
  layout(title = "Monthly Fluctuation on Average Daily Rate (ADR)", 
         xaxis = list(title = "Month"), 
         yaxis = list(title = "Average Daily Rate"))
```
The average daily rate (ADR) for the city hotel increases slightly between May and September, which make sense considering the booking demand pattern for city hotel.The ADR for the resort hotel has more variation throughout the year, and its ADR reaches its peak during Summer.

#### Seasonal Fluctuation
```{r month_lineplot, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
month_line<-hotel_df %>%
  select(hotel,arrival_date_month) %>%
  group_by(hotel, arrival_date_month) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(arrival_date_month,level=month.name),y=count,group = hotel,color = hotel))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))+
  labs(title = "Hotel Booking per Month", x = "Month", y = "Number of Bookings")
  
ggplotly(month_line)
```
City hotel has the most booking in Spring (May-June) and Autumn (October); the number of bookings for the resort hotel has less fluctuation compared to that of the city hotel. The booking demand goes down slightly from June to September for the resort hotel. 



#### Room Type Investigation
```{r roomType, echo=F,message=F,warning=F}
rmType_adr_box<-hotel_df %>%
  select(hotel,assigned_room_type,adr) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = assigned_room_type, y = adr, fill = hotel))+
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(1,preserve = "single"))+
  ylim(-10,350)+
  labs(x="Assigned Room Type",y = "ADR",title = "Assigned Room Type vs. ADR - Box")



rmType_adr_line<-hotel_df %>%
  select(hotel,assigned_room_type,adr) %>%
  group_by(hotel,assigned_room_type) %>%
  summarize(adr=mean(adr)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = assigned_room_type, y = adr,color = hotel,group=hotel))+
  geom_line()+
  ylim(-10,250)+
  labs(x = "Assigned Room Type", y = "ADR", title = "Assigned Room Type vs. ADR - Line")

library(patchwork)
rmType_adr_box/rmType_adr_line
```

#### Potential influence factors for cancellation

##### Assigned room type

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, assigned_room_type) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, assigned_room_type) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()
    ) %>%
  mutate(assigned_room_type = fct_reorder(assigned_room_type, n_obs)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~assigned_room_type, y = ~n_obs,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The distribution of assigned room type for two hotels",
         xaxis = list(title = "Assigned room type"),
         yaxis = list(title = "The number of assigned rooms"))
  
prop_df = 
  hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, assigned_room_type) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, assigned_room_type) %>% 
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(),
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "1")
  )

result_df = 
  prop_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(hotel, assigned_room_type, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

  result_df %>% 
  mutate(assigned_room_type = fct_reorder(assigned_room_type, estimate)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~assigned_room_type, y = ~estimate,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The proportion of cancellation with assigned room type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Assigned room type")
  )
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that the cancellation proportion is highest among guests who were assigned room type P for both hotels. However, from the first distribution of assigned room type plot, we know that the number of assigned P type room is extremely low for both hotel, so we could ignore this room type at this point. Expect for room type P, we found that the cancellation proportion is distinctly high among guests who were assigned room type A, G, H with comparable sizes for Resort Hotel. As for City hotel, the cancellation proportion is found to be highest among guests who were assigned room type A with comparable size. Since this data set also contains another variable called "reserved room type" which is chosen by guests themselves. Therefore, we might infer that the room types mentioned before would not meet the expectations and needs of guests compared to their originally reserved room type so that make them cancel the order.

#### Distribution Channel

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, distribution_channel) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, distribution_channel) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(distribution_channel = fct_reorder(distribution_channel, n_obs)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~distribution_channel, y = ~n_obs,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The distribution of distribution channel for two hotels",
         xaxis = list(title = "Distribution Channel"),
         yaxis = list(title = "The number of choosen channels"))

channel_prop_df = 
  hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, distribution_channel) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, distribution_channel) %>% 
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(),
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "1")
  )

channel_result_df = 
  channel_prop_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(hotel, distribution_channel, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

channel_result_df %>% 
  mutate(distribution_channel = fct_reorder(distribution_channel, estimate)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~distribution_channel, y = ~estimate,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The proportion of cancellation with distribution channels",
         xaxis = list(title = "Distribution Channel")
  )

```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that the cancellation proportion is the highest among guest who booked the room through the TA/TO channel (“TA” means “Travel Agents” and “TO” means “Tour Operators”) for both hotels. Therefore, we could infer that this kind of channels may exists some problems such as information asymmetry with the hotel website, which could mislead guests when they make the decision. But the actual condition of the hotel might not meet the expectations or needs of guests so that they cancel the order.  

#### Meal type

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, meal) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, meal) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(meal = fct_reorder(meal, n_obs)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~meal, y = ~n_obs,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The distribution of meal type for two hotels",
         xaxis = list(title = "Meal Type"),
         yaxis = list(title = "The number of booked meal type"))

meal_prop_df = 
  hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, meal) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, meal) %>% 
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(),
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "1")
  )

meal_result_df = 
  meal_prop_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(hotel, meal, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

meal_result_df %>% 
  mutate(meal = fct_reorder(meal, estimate)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~meal, y = ~estimate,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The proportion of cancellation with meal type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Meal Type")
  )

```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that for Resort hotel, the cancellation proportion is highest among guests who booked FB meal with comparable size; for City hotel, the cancellation proportion is highest among guests who booked BB meal. Therefore, we could infer that these two meal types might not meet the expectations and needs of guests, which leads them to cancel the order.

#### The repeated guest effect

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, is_repeated_guest) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, is_repeated_guest) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    is_repeated_guest = as.factor(is_repeated_guest),
    is_repeated_guest = fct_reorder(is_repeated_guest, n_obs)
    ) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~is_repeated_guest, y = ~n_obs,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The distribution of repeated guests for two hotels",
         xaxis = list(title = "Repeated Guest"),
         yaxis = list(title = "The number of orders"))

repeated_prop_df = 
  hotel_df %>% 
  select(hotel, is_canceled, is_repeated_guest) %>% 
  group_by(hotel, is_repeated_guest) %>% 
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(),
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "1")
  )

repeated_result_df = 
  repeated_prop_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(hotel, is_repeated_guest, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

repeated_result_df %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~is_repeated_guest, y = ~estimate,
    type = "bar", color = ~hotel, colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "The proportion of cancellation with repeated guest",
         xaxis = list(title = "Repeated Guest")
  )
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that for both hotels, the cancellation proportion is significantly higher among non-repeated guests, which meets the common expectation for the repeated guest effect. 


#### The Lead Time effect

```{r leadtime, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
leadtime <-   
  hotel_df %>%
  select(hotel, is_canceled, lead_time) %>%
  mutate(is_canceled = recode(is_canceled, "1" = "Canceled", "0" = "Not Canceled"))

leadtime_box <- 
  leadtime %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~is_canceled, y = ~lead_time,
    type = "box", color = ~hotel, 
    colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "Cancellation Distribution with Lead Time",
         xaxis = list(title = "cancellation"),
         yaxis = list(title = "lead time (days)"),
         boxmode = "group"
         )

leadtime_box
```
Based on the box plot, we found that, for both city and resort hotels, the medians of lead time among being canceled reservations are relatively higher than those of not being canceled. 


#### The Deposit Type Effect

```{r deposit, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
deposit_df <- 
  hotel_df %>%
  mutate(is_canceled = recode(is_canceled, "1" = "Canceled", "0" = "Not Canceled")) %>%
  select(hotel, is_canceled, deposit_type)


deposit_prop <- 
  deposit_df %>%
  group_by(deposit_type, hotel) %>%
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(), 
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "Canceled")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_test) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(deposit_type, hotel, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


deposit_prop_plot <- 
  deposit_prop %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("\nCancellation Proportion: ", estimate)) %>%
    plot_ly(
    x = ~deposit_type, y = ~estimate, color = ~hotel,
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis", text = ~text_label
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "Canceled Proportion with Deposit Type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Deposit Type"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Proportion of Cancellation", range = c(0, 1)), 
         barmode = "group"
)

deposit_prop_plot
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that for both resort and city hotels, reservations with non-refundable deposit have about 94% and 99% of cancellation respectively, which is significantly higher than other two types of deposits. For reservations with refundable deposit, we found that the cancellation of city hotel is relatively higher than that of resort hotel. 



#### The Special Request Effect

```{r specialrequest, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
special_request_df <- 
  hotel_df %>%
  mutate(is_canceled = recode(is_canceled, "1" = "Canceled", "0" = "Not Canceled")) %>%
  select(hotel, is_canceled, total_of_special_requests)


special_request_prop <- 
  special_request_df %>%
  group_by(total_of_special_requests, hotel) %>%
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(), 
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "Canceled")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_test) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(total_of_special_requests, hotel, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


special_request_prop_plot <- 
  special_request_prop %>%
    plot_ly(
    x = ~total_of_special_requests, y = ~estimate, color = ~hotel,
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "Canceled Proportion with Total Number of Special Request",
         xaxis = list(title = "Number of Special Requests"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Proportion of Cancellation", range = c(0, 1)), 
         barmode = "group"
)

special_request_prop_plot
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that, for city hotel, the cancellation proportion is the highest when the guests didn't ask for any special request. Similarly, for resort hotel, the cancellation proportion is also higher when guests didn't ask for any special request. 


#### The Customer Type Effect

```{r customertype, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
customer_df <- 
  hotel_df %>%
  mutate(is_canceled = recode(is_canceled, "1" = "Canceled", "0" = "Not Canceled")) %>%
  select(hotel, is_canceled, customer_type)

customer_prop <- 
  customer_df %>%
  group_by(customer_type, hotel) %>%
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(), 
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "Canceled")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_test) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(customer_type, hotel, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


customer_prop_plot <- 
  customer_prop %>%
  mutate(customer_type = fct_reorder(customer_type, estimate)) %>%
    plot_ly(
    x = ~customer_type, y = ~estimate, color = ~hotel,
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "Canceled Proportion with Different Customer Type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Customer Types"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Proportion of Cancellation", range = c(0, 1)), 
         barmode = "group"
)

customer_prop_plot
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that for city hotel, the cancellation proportion is significantly higher among contract and transient customers. While for resort hotel, the cancellation proportion is significantly higher among transient party and transient customers. 


#### The Market Segment Effect

For the two hotels analyzed in this report, there are seven market segment designations for customers to reserve rooms. 
Aviation
Complementary 
Corporate
Direct
Groups
Offline travel agents or tour operators, abbreviated as offline TA/TO later
Online travel agents, abbreviated as online TA later

```{r segment, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
segment_df <- 
  hotel_df %>%
  mutate(is_canceled = recode(is_canceled, "1" = "Canceled", "0" = "Not Canceled")) %>%
  select(hotel, is_canceled, market_segment)

segment_prop <- 
  segment_df %>%
  group_by(market_segment, hotel) %>%
  summarize(
    guest_total = n(), 
    guest_canceled = sum(is_canceled == "Canceled")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = guest_canceled, .y = guest_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>%
  select(-prop_test) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(market_segment, hotel, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


segment_prop_plot <- 
  segment_prop %>%
  mutate(market_segment = fct_reorder(market_segment, estimate)) %>%
    plot_ly(
    x = ~market_segment, y = ~estimate, color = ~hotel,
    type = "bar", colors = "viridis"
  ) %>%
  layout(title = "Canceled Proportion with Different Customer Type",
         xaxis = list(title = "Customer Types"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Proportion of Cancellation", range = c(0, 1)), 
         barmode = "group"
)

segment_prop_plot
```

Based on the proportion plot, we found that for city hotel, the cancellation proportion is significantly higher among grouped customers, and relatively higher among offline TA/TO and online TA  reservation customers. For the resort hotel, the grouped customers and customers reserved through online TA has relatively higher cancellation proportion than other types of customers.

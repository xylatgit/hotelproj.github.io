### Analysis and Prediction of Hotel Booking and Cancellation

The dataset provides information about the duration of stay, the time of
booking, and the visit’s daily rate. We are interested in the most
popular time during the year for hotel booking and the association
between the daily rate and the length of stay. For customers, what
factors contribute to a better daily rate. For hotel managers, what kind
of order is more likely to be canceled.  
  
We intend to create a website introducing the dataset, including
interactive plots displaying the variables in the dataset, and creating
shiny apps for users. In addition, we will perform statistical analysis
using several supervised learning techniques and display the results.  
  
We plan to perform statistical analyses using several supervised
learning techniques. We are interested to see whether there is an
association between certain variables and hotel cancellation. We first
plan to create the correlation plots of the variables and detect any
significant correlation. After selecting interested variables, we will
fit several supervised learning models and select the best performing
model.  
  
In the exploratory data analysis, we will plot the variables and see
whether we could see the correlation between the distribution of
cancellation and any seasonality trend. We expect coding challenges
include, data cleaning, supervised learning models (variable selection),
and HTML coding.  
  
Data was obtained directly from the hotels’ PMS databases’ servers by
executing a TSQL query on SQL Server Studio Manager. (Antonio, et.al)

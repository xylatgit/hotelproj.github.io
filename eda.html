<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The data <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191"><strong>Hotel Booking Demand Dataset</strong></a> were collected from two hotels (Resort hotel and City hotel) located in Portugal. It contains hotel booking information between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017. For a speedy performance of our predictive model, we only select data from 2016 for training.</p>
<p>The dimension of the original published dataset is 119390 rows by 32 columns. After filtering instances from year 2016, the resulting dataset has 56707 rows.</p>
<p>We aim to explore the following questions using our exploratory data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do the guests come from?<br />
</li>
<li>How does price vary over the year?<br />
</li>
<li>What are the potential factors which could influence the cancellation of both hotels?</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the proportion plot, we found that the cancellation proportion is highest among guests who were assigned room type P for both hotels. However, from the first distribution of assigned room type plot, we know that the number of assigned P type room is extremely low for both hotel, so we could ignore this room type at this point. Expect for room type P, we found that the cancellation proportion is distinctly high among guests who were assigned room type A, G, H with comparable sizes for Resort Hotel. As for City hotel, the cancellation proportion is found to be highest among guests who were assigned room type A with comparable size. Since this data set also contains another variable called “reserved room type” which is chosen by guests themselves. Therefore, we might infer that the room types mentioned before would not meet the expectations and needs of guests compared to their originally reserved room type so that make them cancel the order.</p>

<p>Based on the proportion plot, we found that the cancellation proportion is the highest among guest who booked the room through the TA/TO channel (“TA” means “Travel Agents” and “TO” means “Tour Operators”) for both hotels. Therefore, we could infer that this kind of channels may exists some problems such as information asymmetry with the hotel website, which could mislead guests when they make the decision. But the actual condition of the hotel might not meet the expectations or needs of guests so that they cancel the order.</p>
